# TODO

A simple list of stuff that I need to do/explore but don't trust my memory to
serve me well.

- Implement disko (https://github.com/nix-community/disko)
- Explore fragmenting this repo to reduce amount of code present in here that isn't system configuration
- Look to expand impertenance (https://github.com/nix-community/impermanence) to create more ephemeral environments for desktops and servers
- Look at if there is ways to speed up current eval of systems (flake recursion :sadpanda:)
- neovim setup - HM module is a stub and would be good to expand this and replace VScode possibly

WIP but not done:

- SBOM generation
- Microvms
- ZTA networking via tailscale/headscale
- Expand cloud images deployable
