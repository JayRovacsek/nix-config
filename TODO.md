# TODO

A simple list of stuff that I need to do/explore but don't trust my memory to
serve me well.

- Implement [disko](https://github.com/nix-community/disko)
- Fully implement [impermanence](https://github.com/nix-community/impermanence)
- [styx implementation for documentation](https://github.com/styx-static/styx)
- services.endlessh.enable
- [ntfy](https://ntfy.sh/)

WIP but not finished:

- SBOM generation
- ZTA networking via tailscale/headscale (changes to users in headscale need to be implemented)
- Expand cloud images deployable
