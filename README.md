# nix-config

![What in tarnation](https://github.com/JayRovacsek/ncsg-presentation-feb-2022/blob/main/resources/what-in.jpg?raw=true)

This repo contains my flake'd nix configs, it's a work in progress and currently being migrated to from [my old configs](https://github.com/JayRovacsek/dotfiles)

## Using this/something like this

Bootstrap yourself some Nix, ensure you've got flake support and then depending on if you're using Linux or Darwin modify the relevant nixosConfigurations/darwinConfigurations 

Note that in building/switching to the config you're after you'll need to either define _what_ config you're using or ensure the name of the config matches your target system hostname.

To arbitrarily test/dry-build a config you can use standard flake pathing, for example on a linux system:

```sh
# Match on hostname
nixos-rebuild dry-build --flake .# 
# Build alakazam
nixos-rebuild dry-build --flake .#alakazam 
```

Of-course these could just be tested using the subcommand for `nixos-rebuild` of `test`.

```sh
# Match on hostname
nixos-rebuild test --flake .#
# Test alakazam
nixos-rebuild test --flake .#alakazam 
```

## Debugging

If you also have spent countless hours just wanting to do and not RTFM like I have, you might want to utilise the repl and/or `builtins.trace` when the time comes.

To load this (or any flake via the repl):
```sh
nix repl # You should be in a repl now, ensure you remember exit is Ctrl + D

:lf . # Period here is just the path to a directory containing a flake. Here we assume it is in $PWD

# An example; to look at what vlans exist of jigglypuff:
nixosConfigurations.jigglypuff.options.networking.vlans.value

# Which should return the below at time of writing
{ dns = { ... }; }

# Delving deeper on this is easy as using shell history and tabbing for auto-complete
nixosConfigurations.jigglypuff.options.networking.vlans.v
alue.dns.interface

# For darwin configs, example of exploring the options applied against cloyster:
darwinConfigurations.cloyster.options
```

## Config Theme

They're all named after [characters from the GOAT RPG](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFU2HL-PQNo)

Breaking the use-case down:
- alakazam; personal workstation
- cloyster; work macbook
- dragonite; home server
- jigglypuff; rpi3
- wigglytuff; rpi4
