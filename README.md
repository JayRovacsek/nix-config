# nix-config
My nix configs, following the the premise:
* Systems define config
* A system utilises a base package set
* A system set should address:
    * The basis of the OS: WM/DE etc
* A user introduces a layer of packages specific to them
* A user could apply changes to the system configs but does not choose the base set, rather the settings of that set
* A system or user may apply services
