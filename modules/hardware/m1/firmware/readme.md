# Missing Firmware tar blob

This folder is intentionally lacking a tar file that includes firmware for wireless and more on m1.

Instructions on generating this tar file are contained in the original work by [tpwrules](https://github.com/tpwrules/nixos-m1/blob/main/docs/uefi-standalone.md) or alternatively forked and [kept stale here](https://github.com/JayRovacsek/nixos-m1)
